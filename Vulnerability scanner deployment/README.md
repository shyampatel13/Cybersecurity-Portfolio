## Vulnerability scanner deployment
In this project, we will deploy a vulnerability scanner using Nessus. It will scan for potential vulnerabilties in a virtual machine and provide remediation solutions to prevent them from being exploited.

### 1. Setting up & configuring VM
Here we setup our VM and configured some settings, such as:

* Disabling windows defender firewall profiles
* Turning off automatic service updates
* Ping the VM to verify its IP and can be reachable

### 2. Setting up & configuring Nessus
Installation of Nessus and configuration of our host for the basic network host scan, Including:

* Adding the host configurations to the scanner
* Ability to choose a scheduled scan and how to setup notifications
* Applying host credentials for the VM by using the 'whoami' command to identify admin and domain name

### 3. Install vulnerable software
Here we installed some outdated vulnerable software that the scanner will notice and immediatly mark as a known vulnerability. This software includes

* Outdated version of google chrome
* Outdated version of 7zip file extracter
* Outdated version of minecraft server hosting

### 4. Running initial scan to identify vulnerabilities and perform remediation efforts
Nessus identified many vulnerabilities that were critical and listed them in order of severity. Solutions were provided to help with remediation efforts. For example:

* Upgrading outdated software (7zip, google chrome, etc)
* Turning on automatic updates
* Uninstalling exploitable software (minecraft server)
* Enabling windows network firewalls

### 5. Conducting final scan to verify scanner remediations
A final scan is performed to verify that the scanner has successfully acknowledged the remediations performed. The final scan of the host VM concluded with FEWER vulnerabilities and did NOT include from sources of the vulnerable software that was downloaded. In conclusion, Nessus scans are vital to any network systems for vulnerability management by identifying vulnerabilities with severity ratings, explaining why and how this can be exploited, and providing remediation solutions to address the problem.
