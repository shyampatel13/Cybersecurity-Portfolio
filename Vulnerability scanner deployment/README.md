## Vulnerability scanner deployment
In this project, we will deploy a vulnerability scanner using Nessus. It will scan for potential vulnerabilties in a virtual machine and provide remediation solutions to prevent them from being exploited.

### 1. Setting up & configuring VM
Here we setup our VM and configured some settings, such as:

* Turning off automatic service updates
* Disabling windows defender firewall profiles
* Ping the VM to verify its IP and can be reachable

### 2. Setting up & configuring Nessus
Installation of Nessus and configuration of our host for the basic network host scan, Including:

* Selected manual scans with no notification alerts
* Applying host credentials for the VM by using the 'whoami' command to identify admin and domain name
* Adding the host configurations to the scanner

### 3. Install vulnerable software
Here we installed some outdated vulnerable software that the scanner will notice and immediatly mark as a known vulnerability. This software includes:

* Outdated version of 7zip file extracter
* Outdated version of google chrome
* Outdated version of minecraft server hosting

### 4. Running initial scan to identify vulnerabilities and view remediation solutions
Nessus identified many vulnerabilities that were critical and listed them in order of severity. Many of these include actions we performed intentionally to test this software for accuracy and simulate finding vulnerabilities in a professional environment.

Solutions were provided to help with remediation efforts. For example:

* Upgrading outdated software (7zip, google chrome, etc)
* Turning on automatic updates
* Uninstalling exploitable software (minecraft server)
* Enabling windows network firewalls

### 5. Conducting a final scan after performing remediations to verify scanner accuracy
A final scan is performed to verify that the scanner has successfully acknowledged the remediations performed. The final scan of the host VM concluded with FEWER vulnerabilities and did NOT include from sources of the vulnerable software that was downloaded. In conclusion, Nessus scans are vital to any network systems for vulnerability management by identifying vulnerabilities with severity ratings, explaining why and how this can be exploited, and providing remediation solutions to address the problem.

Here you can see the # of vulnerabilities has gone down significantly from 13 critical & 29 high to now ONLY 1 critical & 1 high, after performing the remediations given my the Nessus scanning software.
